# CI-CD-Pipeline-Jenkins-Sonarqube-Docker
We will create an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins on it. We will then set up a Github repository and integrate it with Jenkins. Next, we will configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in our Github repository. Finally, we will create a Docker image of our application and deploy it using Jenkins.
